### Detection Pipeline Flow

![Data Flow Diagram](splunk/data_flow_diagram.png)

*End-to-end data flow from ingestion through detection to incident response*

**Pipeline Stages:**

1. **Data Acquisition** → Windows Security, Sysmon, AWS CloudTrail
2. **Normalization** → Splunk indexing and field extraction  
3. **Detection** → Rule-based (20+ rules) + ML anomaly detection
4. **Incident Management** → TheHive case creation with automated enrichment
5. **Response** → Automated playbooks and analyst workflows

**Severity Classification:**
Score > p99.7  → Critical (Severity 5) → Immediate Alert
Score p99-p99.7 → High (Severity 4)    → Alert within 5 min
Score < p99     → Medium (Severity 3)  → Monitor
